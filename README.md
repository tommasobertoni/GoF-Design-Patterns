# Gang of Four - Design Patterns

Project designed to learn how to implement all of the design patterns described in the well-known book:<br>
> ["Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

All the implementations are made in <i>Java</i>.
